```

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms ✅

**Error Handling Features:**
- **Cache Corruption Recovery**: Automatic detection and repair of corrupted cache files
- **Network Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of connection failures
- **File Locking**: Cross-process synchronization with platform-specific implementations
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automatic cleanup on failed operations

**Recovery Mechanisms:**
- **Smart Cache Recovery**: Rebuild from cloud when corruption detected
- **Cloud Structure Repair**: Automatic fixing of missing/orphaned metadata
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working with reduced functionality
- **Integrity Validation**: Comprehensive cache validation with checksum verification

**Implementation:**
```python
# Cache corruption recovery
def recover_from_corruption(self, cloud_sync_manager=None, progress_callback=None):
    # Try cloud recovery first, fallback to cache clearing
    
# Cloud structure repair
def repair_cloud_structure(self, integrity_results, progress_callback=None):
    # Fix missing metadata indexes and orphaned entries
    
# Comprehensive error handling in all operations
try:
    # Operation
except SpecificError as e:
    # Specific handling
except Exception as e:
    # Graceful fallback
```

### 4. Backward Compatibility Verification ✅

**Compatibility Features:**
- **Legacy Session Format**: Full support for pre-optimization session formats
- **Old Cache Structure**: Graceful handling of missing fields with defaults
