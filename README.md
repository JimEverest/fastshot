## Plugin Mechanism
Fastshot supports a plugin mechanism, allowing for functionality extensions to meet various business needs. You can develop custom plugins to enhance or modify the tool's capabilities.

1. Create a Plugin Class: Your plugin should be a Python class with the desired functionality. For example, an OCR plugin might look like this:
```python
from paddleocr import PaddleOCR
from PIL import Image
import win32clipboard
import tkinter as tk

class PluginOCR:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ocr_engine = PaddleOCR(use_angle_cls=True, lang='en')

    def ocr(self, image):
        result = self.ocr_engine.ocr(image, cls=True)
        ocr_text = "\n".join([line[1][0] for res in result for line in res])
        self.copy_to_clipboard(ocr_text)
        return ocr_text

    def copy_to_clipboard(self, text):
        win32clipboard.OpenClipboard()
        win32clipboard.EmptyClipboard()
        win32clipboard.SetClipboardText(text, win32clipboard.CF_UNICODETEXT)
        win32clipboard.CloseClipboard()

    def show_message(self, message, parent):
        label = tk.Label(parent, text=message, bg="yellow", fg="black", font=("Helvetica", 10))
        label.pack(side="bottom", fill="x")
        parent.after(3000, label.destroy)
```
2. Register the Plugin: In the SnipasteApp class, you can register your plugin by adding it to the plugin list.
```python
class SnipasteApp:
    def load_plugins(self):
        plugin_modules = ['fastshot.plugin_ocr']  # Add your plugin module here
        for module_name in plugin_modules:
            module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
            plugin_class = getattr(module, 'PluginOCR')
            self.plugins[module_name] = plugin_class()
```

3. Invoke the Plugin: You can invoke the plugin from your application code, such as from a menu item.
```python
def ocr(self):
    plugin = self.app.plugins.get('fastshot.plugin_ocr')
    if plugin:
        img_path = 'temp.png'
        self.img_label.zoomed_image.save(img_path)
        result = plugin.ocr(img_path)
        plugin.show_message("OCR result updated in clipboard", self.img_window)
```
By following these steps, you can create and integrate custom plugins to extend the functionality of Fastshot.
